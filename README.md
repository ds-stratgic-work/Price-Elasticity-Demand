# Project Name : Price Elasticity Demand and Calculation

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is understanding of how changes in price impacts directly the quantity damand of a product. The learning of the formula, the determinants and effective calculation is the need of a successful busines aspect. The indepth knowledge of Individual Price Elasticity of demand helps in decision making, price optimization & strategy building.These aids in making business successful.

### Methods Used
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter

### Model Used:
* GAM Model-  GAM stands for Generalized Additive Models that smoothen the semi-parametric models.
* Optimization : XGBoost

### Project Description
Price elasticity of demand is a measurement of the change in the demand for a product in relation to a change in its price. Elastic demand is when the change in demand is large when there is a change in price. Inelastic demand is when the change in demand is small when there is a change in price.
